# Progress log (append-only, newest at bottom)

Each iteration appends: date, what changed, why, evidence (test/lint/backtest
numbers), and what's next. Negative results are recorded too — they prune the
search.

## Iteration 0 — 2026-06-08 — review, keystone, and the loop

**Context.** First comprehensive review of the repo. Found a well-built safety/
accounting chassis with no profitable engine: every live agent bleeds after
costs, and there was no way to discover edge before risking capital.

**Changed.**
- Added the **backtest harness** `src/hl_bot/backtest/` (`engine.py`, `data.py`)
  and the `hlbot backtest` CLI command. It replays an agent's real `decide()`
  over historical frames with an explicit cost+funding model, writes synthetic
  fills, and scores via the production `score_agent`. Includes a `maker` flag to
  isolate the taker tax and equity-curve Sharpe/maxDD/Calmar. Tests in
  `tests/test_backtest.py`.
- Fixed **red CI**: ruff `B007` in `scripts/daily_scorecard.py`; aligned
  `make lint` to lint `scripts` too (it had drifted from CI's `ruff check .`).
- Wrote `docs/REVIEW.md` (full findings) and `docs/ROADMAP_TO_1M.md` (the
  numbers-first path), and stood up this Ralph loop (`ralph/`).

**Evidence.** `uv run pytest -q` → **47 passed** (5 new). `uv run ruff check .`
→ **All checks passed**. Backtest tests confirm: a mean-reversion path scores
profitable without costs; the same path nets strictly less as a taker; the
simulated clock drives max-hold exits.

**Findings recorded for follow-up.** REVIEW C1–C7, M1–M6, D1–D3 → mapped to
backlog B1–B17.

**What's next.** B1 — quantify the taker→maker gap on twap_mr/femr over real
history. **Blocked here:** the sandbox cannot reach api.hyperliquid.xyz (403), so
this must run where HL history is reachable, or implement B1a (offline cache)
first. If unblocked, the immediate hypothesis to test is: *most of the bleed is
the spread*, which would make B2 (maker execution) the highest-value next build.

## Iteration 1 — 2026-06-08 — production-hardening toward a safe go-live

**Context.** Directive: "start the loop, move it toward production and live." Did
NOT enable live trading — strategies still have negative edge after costs and the
switch is human-gated by design (see `docs/GO_LIVE.md`). Instead worked the P0/P1
items that *earn* the right to go live. B1 stays network-blocked here, so I took
the highest-value unblocked items.

**Changed (4 green-gated commits).**
- **B8 — real fill price.** `femr_tick` logged the pre-trade mid as the entry on a
  confirmed fill; now records `res.avg_px`/`res.filled_sz` so stops/TPs/age key
  off the real fill. (REVIEW M1.)
- **B3 — twap_mr_regime_v1.** New agent that consults `regime_allows_fade` and
  drops fades against a strong trend — the #1 loss loop (REVIEW C3). Plumbed a
  trailing `closes` series through `backtest.Frame` and the live `_enrich_view`.
  **Evidence:** cost-free synthetic uptrend, baseline TWAP nets **−$7.88** fading
  the rip; regime variant nets **−$4.00** (2 trades vs 4) by refusing those fades
  (`tests/test_regime_twap.py`). Real-data tuning pending B1.
- **B2 (primitive) — maker execution.** `place_limit_order` (post-only "Alo" so it
  can never become a taker), `round_price_to` (HL tick rules), `has_resting_order`.
  Tested via fake exchange + rounding cases. The *payoff* half (async resting-order
  fill reconciliation + routing live entries to maker) is queued as **B2b**.
- **B14 — go-live runbook.** `docs/GO_LIVE.md`: the gated checklist, secrets/env,
  promote/kill-switch/rollback, monitoring. The honest definition of "live."

**Evidence.** 47 → **56 tests pass**; `ruff check .` clean each commit.

**Readiness.** Still **NOT live-ready** (by design): no strategy has passed G0
(needs real-history backtests — B1), and live entries are still taker until B2b.
The regime TWAP is the leading G0 candidate.

**What's next.** B1a (offline history cache) to unblock B1 in this sandbox, then
B2b (async maker entries) — together they let the regime/carry strategies be
backtested *and* executed as makers, which is the whole ballgame for a positive
live edge.
